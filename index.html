                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p>
                    I am passionate about creating products and user interfaces that our users like to use. During my time at Northrop I have been able to work on a variety of applications and all with their own tech stack. From working on applications built on JavaFx and Java to working on web based applications that use JavaScript with a Vue.js framework I have gained a wide breath of experience and have overcome many challenges. I love taking on new challenges and trying new things. Previously I was the Scrum Master for a DevOps team where we were administrators for products such as Atlassian, Jenkins, Nexus, and SonarQube.
